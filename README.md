#Hello, I’m Sri

Welcome to my corner of the internet.
I’m a passionate creator, lifelong learner, and someone who believes in the power of ideas brought to life through design and code.

#What You’ll Find Here

This site is more than a showcase — it’s a reflection of my journey.

Projects & Work — A curated collection of what I’ve built, from concept to completion.

Skills & Tools — Technologies I often work with, and areas I’m actively exploring.

About Me — Who I am beyond the screens: what drives me, what inspires me.

Contact & Collaboration — I’m always open to new challenges, conversations, and opportunities.

#My Philosophy

I believe that intentional simplicity and user-centric thinking go hand in hand.
Every line of code, every layout choice, every interaction should serve a purpose — to delight, to solve, to communicate.

I’m not just building sites or apps — I’m crafting experiences.
And I’m continually evolving — learning new tools, exploring design patterns, and embracing feedback.

#What Inspires Me

Clean, minimal design that still feels warm and human

Open-source communities, where knowledge is shared freely

Everyday problems waiting to be simplified or improved

Conversations, ideas, and stories from diverse people
